## Creating a new page

The justice website makes extensive use of page hierarchies to organise content. 
When creating a new page, you will need to correctly set the parent page:
it will determine the URL of the page, and where it will appear in the site's navigation.

To set the parent page at the same time as creating a new page:

<figure class="mb-4">
  <div class="annotated-screenshot">
   <img alt="Screenshot of the Page Tree View screen" src="../assets/page-tree-view.png" />
   <ol>
      <li id="annotation-tree-view" class="label" style="top: 48%; left: 9%;" >Tree View</li>
      <li id="annotation-add-new-page" class="label" style="top: 48%; left: 48%;" >Add New page</li>
      <li id="annotation-title" class="label" style="top: 56%; left: 51%;" >Title</li>
      <li id="annotation-add" class="label" style="bottom: 15%; right: 62%;" >Add</li>
   </ol>
  </div>

</figure>

1. From the Sidebar, click Pages > Tree View.
1. Navigate the page tree to find the parent page.
1. Hover the parent page to and click 'Add new inside'.
1. Enter the page title(s).
  You have the option to create multiple pages at once, but there is less risk of error if you create one page at a time.
1. Click Add.

### Editing page content

For details on how to edit page content, see the [Block editor](./block-editor.md) documentation.

   1. Title tag
1. Meta data

### Gotchas

but be aware that it is not useful for scheduling a revision, because it will 
take the page offline until the scheduled date.

## Updating or editing an existing a page

Pages can be edited one of 2 ways, either directly or by creating a new revision. 
Direct editing will update the page immediately, and my be appropriate to fix a broken link or a typo.
Scheduling a revision will allow you to make changes to a page that will go live at a later date, 
and is appropriate for updating pages as legislation is updated.

## Q & A

### How do I save a page in draft status and find the draft page to re-edit at a later time?

This is a 2 part answer depending on whether you are working on a new page, or an existing page.

If you are working on a new page, you can create a page as usual - as in the 'Creating a new page' section.
After editing, click Save Draft in the top right corner of the page editor.

To find this page at a later date, you can navigate to it via Pages > Tree View.
Alternatively, go to Pages > All Pages and click the Drafts tab towards the top of the screen.

If you are working on an existing page, you should create a new revision, not a draft.
Follow the steps in the 'Scheduling a revision to an existing page' section.

Except, submit the revision, but do not approve it, until you are ready for your changes to go live or be scheduled.
To find this revision at a later date, you can navigate to it via Revisions > Revision Queue, 
it will have the status of 'Submitted'.

### How do I delete a draft page?

If you have created a draft page, and no longer need it, you can delete it by following these steps:

1. From the Sidebar, click Pages > All Pages.
1. Click the Drafts tab towards the top of the screen.
1. Hover the page you want to delete, and click the Bin/Trash link.
