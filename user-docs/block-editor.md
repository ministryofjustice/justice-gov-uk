### Using the page editor

## Blocks

The block editor is used for creating and editing content on the justice website.

A block is a unit of content that can be moved, and edited independently of other blocks.

To see a List View of the blocks on a page, click the Overview button towards the top left of the editor.

### Add a block

To add a new block, click the `+` icon at the top left of the editor.

Alternatively, press `Enter` at the end of a block to create a new block below it.
Type forward slash '/' to see a list of block types you can add, start typing to select the one you want.

### Edit a block

To edit a block, click on the block you want to edit. The majority of blocks are intuitive to edit, and you can usually just start typing.

When you're editing a block, you'll see a toolbar appear above the block. This toolbar contains options for formatting the block, and for moving or deleting the block.

Along the right hand side of the editor, you'll see a sidebar with additional block settings. This sidebar will change depending on the block you have selected.

- Use the Advanced > HTML Anchor field to add a jump link to a block.

## Footnotes

In previous versions of the justice website, footnotes were created using links and anchor tags. 
The current content of the site works exactly like that. 
For example there are links throughout the content that link to footnotes at the bottom of the page.
These can be created and edited in much the same way as any other link.

But, the block editor also has a built-in block for footnotes, which is a more user-friendly way to create footnotes.
To use the footnote block:

- Highlight the text you want to turn into a footnote.
- Click the down arrow towards the right of the toolbar.
- Select the Footnote block from the dropdown menu.
- A Footnote block will be added to the bottom of the page.
- Type the footnote text into the block - the links will be automatically created for you.

## Q & A

Q: How do I change block types. e.g. from a list block to a paragraph(s) block?

A: To change a block type, click on the block you want to change, 
then click on the block type icon at the far left of the toolbar. 
This will open a dropdown menu where you can select the new block type.

If you have a list block (bullets or numbers) you may need to click the block type icon twice.
If your cursor is on a list item, the first click will select the list block, the second click will open the dropdown menu.
