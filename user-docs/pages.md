## Creating a new page

The justice website makes extensive use of page hierarchies to organise content. 
When creating a new page, you will need to correctly set the parent page:
it will determine the URL of the page, and where it will appear in the site's navigation.

To set the parent page at the same time as creating a new page:

- From the Sidebar, click Pages > Tree View.
- Navigate the page tree to find the parent page.
- Hover the parent page to and click 'Add new inside'.
- Enter the page title(s).
  You have the option to create multiple pages at once, but there is less risk of error if you create one page at a time.
- Click Add.

### Editing page content

For details on how to edit page content, see the Block Editor (TODO add link) documentation.

### Additional page settings

When editing a page, you can set additional settings. 
It's more likely that these will be set when creating a new page, rather than editing an existing page.

These settings can be accessed by clicking Page towards the top right of the page editor.

The most used settings are:

- Navigation
  - Short title
  - Title tag
- Meta data
  - Show updated at
  - Modified at (override)
- Panels
  - Show menu
  - Show brand panel
- Sections
- Audiences
- Page Attributes
  - Parent
