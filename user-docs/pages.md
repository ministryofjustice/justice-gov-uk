- ? Saving pages in draft and finding the draft page to re-edit at a later time
- ? Cancelling pages in drafts where revisions have been made so it reverts back to the original text before revisions
- ? How to change block types (I'm having trouble with this, for instance I copy the text and it produces as a list block but how can I change it to a paragraph block, nothing I do seems to work)
