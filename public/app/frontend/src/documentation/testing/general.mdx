# General testing

A general manual spot check should be carried out on all components to ensure they are working as expected. This should
include checking the following:

- Visual appearance
- Responsiveness
- Interaction
- Accessibility
- User flows

## Visual appearance

Simply check that the component looks as expected. This can be done by comparing the component to the design attached to the
ticket where there is one, otherwise just use your best judgement that the component fits with the style of the site and
that nothing looks out of place.

## Responsiveness

Check the component at different screen sizes to ensure it looks good on all devices. This can be done by resizing the
browser window, using the device toolbar in the browser dev tools, or using a service like BrowserStack.

If working in Storybook you can use the viewport addon to quickly check the component at different sizes.
<img src={viewportButton} />

## Accessibility

Ensure that the component is accessible to all users. This can be done by manually checking that the component can be
navigated using a keyboard, that all text is readable, and that all interactive elements are focusable.

If working in Storybook each component, layout and example page has an accessibility tab that will show you any
accessibility violations. If you can't see the addons panel at the bottom of the screen, you can open it by pressing 'A'
on your keyboard.
