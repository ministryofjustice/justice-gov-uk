# Setup

## Frontend only
Our component library is designed so that it can be worked on without running the backend. If you're working on a
component and don't need to integrate it with WordPress, then you should only need to:

1. Checkout the justice-gov-uk repository here: https://github.com/ministryofjustice/justice-gov-uk.
2. `cd` into the `public/app/frontend` directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required packages.
4. Run `npm run storybook` to start Storybook. It should open automatically in your browser at `localhost:6006`.

## Frontend and backend

If you're working on a component and need access to WordPress for integration or testing, checkout the `justice-gov-uk` repository [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/justice-gov-uk) and follow the instructions in the
 README in the `.github` directory. This will get the site running locally.

Storybook should be running on `localhost:6006` and the WordPress site should be running on `justice.docker`.
